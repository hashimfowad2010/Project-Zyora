            <h3>Strict Personal Hygiene and Handwashing</h3>
            <p>Personal hygiene, especially handwashing, is one of the most effective ways to prevent foodborne 
                illness. Before preparing food, cooks should wash their hands with soap and clean water for at 
                least 20 seconds, particularly after touching raw meat, using the bathroom, or handling garbage. 
                Clean hands reduce the transfer of bacteria and viruses to food, utensils, and surfaces. 
                Studies show that many outbreaks begin when food handlers with unclean hands contaminate food. 
                Regular handwashing also includes keeping nails trimmed and avoiding touching the face. Strong 
                hygiene habits protect both the cook and everyone who eats the food.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Preventing Cross-Contamination</h3>
            <p>Cross-contamination occurs when harmful bacteria spread from one food item to another, often through 
                shared cutting boards, knives, or surfaces. To prevent this, kitchens must separate raw foods — like
                 meat and poultry — from ready-to-eat items such as vegetables or cooked dishes. Using different
                  cutting boards and cleaning tools immediately after use stops bacteria from traveling. 
                  Cross-contamination is a common cause of food poisoning because microbes like Salmonella or 
                  E. coli can survive on surfaces. By establishing distinct food preparation zones and cleaning 
                  thoroughly, homes and commercial kitchens significantly lower the risk of dangerous pathogens 
                  reaching food before it’s cooked or served.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Cooking to Safe Internal Temperatures</h3>
            <p>Cooking foods to the right internal temperature is essential for killing harmful microbes that cause
                 foodborne illness. While color and texture may change as food cooks, only a thermometer can confirm
                  that the center has reached a safe temperature. For example, poultry should reach about 74 °C 
                  (165 °F) and ground meats around 71 °C (160 °F) to ensure pathogens are destroyed. Undercooked 
                  food can harbor live bacteria that make people sick even if it looks fully cooked. Using a 
                  reliable food thermometer and checking multiple spots ensures heat penetrates thoroughly. Accurate 
                  cooking habits protect families and customers alike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Proper Temperature Control and Storage</h3>
            <p>Temperature control is a cornerstone of food safety. Bacteria grow very quickly when foods are stored 
                between 4 °C and 60 °C — the so-called “danger zone.” Keeping refrigerators at or below 4 °C and 
                freezers at -18 °C slows bacterial growth and extends the safe life of perishable foods. Cooked 
                foods should be refrigerated within two hours, and leftovers stored in shallow, covered containers 
                so they cool evenly. Thawing food in the refrigerator or cold water, rather than at room temperature, 
                also prevents bacteria from multiplying. Proper storage ensures food remains safe not just when cooked, 
                but while waiting to be eaten.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)</h3>
            <p>The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system is a scientific method used in food 
                processing to prevent hazards before they occur. Instead of inspecting products at the end, HACCP 
                identifies every step where contamination could happen — from receiving raw ingredients to packaging 
                finished products. At each critical point, specific controls and monitoring procedures are put in place 
                to prevent problems. For instance, controlling temperatures during cooking and cooling can stop bacteria 
                from developing. HACCP is widely used in factories, restaurants, and institutional kitchens because it 
                helps reduce risk systematically and improves overall food safety culture in any food operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Cleaning, Waste Management, and Pest Control</h3>
            <p>Routine cleaning and proper waste management are vital to keeping food preparation areas safe. Food 
                particles left on surfaces become breeding grounds for bacteria and attract pests like flies and rodents. 
                By sanitizing all surfaces, equipment, and utensils daily, and disposing of waste promptly and correctly, 
                kitchens eliminate places where microbes can thrive. Pest control measures, such as sealing gaps and using 
                safe traps, prevent animals from contaminating food or storage spaces. Regular cleaning also includes 
                sanitizing handles, containers, and high-touch areas. These practices not only improve cleanliness but 
                also reduce the risk of disease transmission through contaminated food environments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Safe Packaging and Preservation Methods</h3>
            <p>Safe packaging and preservation techniques help protect food after cooking and during processing. Airtight 
                containers prevent exposure to air, moisture, and pests, which can introduce bacteria or spoil food. In 
                industrial settings, methods like pasteurization (heat treatment) or high-pressure processing destroy 
                harmful microbes without lowering nutritional value or taste. These technologies are especially important 
                for milk, juices, and ready-to-eat products. Even at home, using clean, sealed containers for leftovers and 
                labeling storage dates help maintain safety and quality. Well-designed packaging and preservation extend 
                shelf life and keep food safe until it reaches the table.</p>
